                  ineffective. Alien WebMD attempts to critique this alienating process and the many unsavory results of unfettered capitalism today. The zine’s purpose is to act as a creative, community building, and strategic outlet for people living
                  in a system in dire need of restructuring.</p>

                <p>In addition to the alienation we experience through systematic isolation and mediating technologies, the the zine ironically references one of the only strategies capitalists have imagined for resolving the ongoing crisis of the degrading
                  planet: to save themselves by colonizing other planets. WebMD, a health media corporation that includes web-based diagnostic applications, is a quintessential example of late capitalist medicalization, serving as a substitute for community
                  and structural resources while churning out worst-case scenarios. The zine’s title therefore merges these references as a place to showcase and express one’s late capitalist “symptoms” and ways to manage or overcome them.</p>

        <p>I don't make birthday cakes anymore. Instead, I make cakes for less festive occasions. These days college attendees in the US owe nearly $1.5 trillion dollars in student loans. This staggering debt, or the prospect of such debt, shapes the realities,
          imaginations, and futures, of people, young and old, seeking personal enrichment, survival, or a spot in the ever-shrinking middle-class. Under late capitalism, we don't need cakes for birthdays. We need cakes for death days -- the days our
          student loans succumb to the blow of final payment.</p>
        <p>This classic funfetti cake marks the day that Alexander Ersfeld Keilty paid down one of the three student loans he secured to attend a small college in his home state of Minnesota. Alexander currently works as a high school science teacher. He
          estimates, at 33, that he will be in his 40s when he completes his final final student loan payment. In this piece funfetti, arguably the most jovial of cake varieties, contrasts nicely with the pallor of debt in America. </p>

        <h3>Harmonize (TM)</h3>
        <h4>Daria Taback</h4>
        <p>This parody infomercial takes place in an imagined future when sex robots have replaced women as companions. In this world (not a far stretch from our own), the “leftover” women are given the opportunity to become roboticized — replacing their
          autonomy, personality, and preserving them at a young age, while leaving their reproductive organs in tact. This video comments on the persistence of the commodification of women under capitalism. While “you can’t harm a robot,” the promotion
          of non-consensual sex and companionship with someone over whom you have complete control is an old idea recycled in new forms. Less than 5% of RealDoll customers are women.</p>
        <p>Rebecca Solnit articulately argues that “incels” (or “involuntary celibates”) are not just a strange, fringe group of violent misogynistic men, rather they promote “extreme versions of sex under capitalism we’re all familiar with” — transactional
          and one-sided. The idea that women are commodities, toys, and status trophies to which men are entitled has long been a mainstream idea in our culture.</p>

        <h3>How to Be a Woman at 30</h3>
        <h4>Daria Taback</h4>
        <p> This piece addresses patriarchal and commodifying dynamics in relationships and in the workplace. Women are condemned for having expectations while bearing the brunt of emotional laboring and care for others. They are also blamed for not getting
          ahead in their careers, for lack of “leaning in” — often without examining the structural forces that prevent women from being able to “lean.” These examples highlight the lack of consideration for the patriarchal and capitalist conditions that
          cause women to feel powerless, objectified, exchangeable, and lacking in value, particularly after 30, when they start to lose their most effective form of cultural capital: their appeal to men. In response, I embrace the life of the “crazy
          dog lady.”</p>

        <p>This project consists of an 8’ tall dining pod in which participants can eat instant meal Jelly Beans and choose one of three simulated social meal experiences that play on video: <i>Family Dinner, Cool Friends Party,</i> and <i>Romantic Picnic.</i></p>
        <p>The makers of <i>You’re Invited!</i> ask guests to examine the value of eating real food with real people. The project comments on the dining rituals of our fast-paced, production-oriented society that values time-free, instant meals like Soylent
          that enable and encourage workers to not take breaks at the expense of their psychological well being. See more at youreinvited.me.</p>
