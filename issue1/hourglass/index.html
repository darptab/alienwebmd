  <h1>Hourglass Figure</h1>
  <p>I want inner peace, I want to deal with my crushing fear of death,<br>
  I want an hourglass figure and a Cinderella ball gown <br>
  made of real plants.</p>

  <p>So I work 42 hours a week, <br>
  I spend 7 minutes driving to my first job at 9 and<br>
  11 driving to the next one at 2:30 it takes <br>
  half an hour to get back home and you are 18 minutes late.</p>

  <p>I want 9 more minutes to sit across from you and <br>
  Not throw up while you tell me youâ€™re seeing someone new,<br>
  I want to build entire worlds with you and <br>
  Destroy this one, I want to make you so much tea,<br>
  If I could take 5 minutes and put it anywhere in my life I would insert it<br>
  The moment before I met you, to breathe.</p>

  <p>There is absolutely no time at all zero time there is<br>
  None minutes/hours/us so <br>
  I am applying gold leaf directly to my eyelids<br>
  So I am sewing together <br>
  Pink oyster mushrooms so that I may be consumed.</p>
